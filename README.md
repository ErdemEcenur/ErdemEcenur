🌸Hi, I’m Ecenur, or easier to say ‘EJ’! I am a web developer already in the making.<br>
✨A lifelong learner who loves to discover and to create. 
🌟Currently taking a course on front&back end development. Creating digital magic with HTML, CSS, and JS.
 🌈 I have been enjoying this journey using my obsessive attention to details.
As the saying goes, "Slow and steady wins the race.”
⚡️Stick around to follow up on this journey with me while I turn my daily caffeine dose into code!
