<h1> Hello World! 🍀 </h1>

🌸 I’m Ecenur, or easier to say ‘EJ’! I am a web developer already in the making.<br>
✨ A lifelong learner who loves to discover and to create.<br>
🌟 Currently taking a course on front&back end development. Creating digital magic with HTML, CSS, and JS. <br>
🌈 I have been enjoying this journey using my obsessive attention to details.
As the saying goes, "Be obsessed or be average.” <br>
⚡️ Stick around to follow up on this journey with me while I turn my daily caffeine dose into code!
